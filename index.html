        <h1 class="his">HISTORY</h1>
        <p class="abc">Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the
            centre of which
            is a
            22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The
            batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running
            between
            the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving
            the
            field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of
            dismissal
            include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either
            catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the
            ball
            before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the
            innings
            ends and the teams swap roles</p>
   
    <p class="a">Cricket is one of many games in the "club ball" sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a
        hand-held
        implement; others include baseball (which shares many similarities with cricket, both belonging in the more
        specific bat-and-ball games category[2]), golf, hockey, tennis, squash, badminton and table tennis.[3] In
        cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is
        thought, a "wicket gate" through which sheep were herded), that the batter must defend.</p>
    <p class="b">Although the main object of the game has always been to score the most runs, the early form of cricket
        differed
        from the modern game in certain key technical aspects; the North American variant of cricket known as wicket
        retained many of these aspects.</p>
